# Zettelkasten iA Writer Workflow
This AppleScript service will create a new empty note with the current date and time
in ISO 8601 format as its title.

## Installation
[Download this repo as a
.zip](https://github.com/daneden/ia-writer-zettelkasten/archive/main.zip), open
it up, and double-click the “Zettelkasten” file to install it as a service.

You’ll also have the option to assign a keyboard shortcut. I use ⌘⌥Z for the
global shortcut and also remap iA Writer’s ⌘N to run it.
